            My name is Mary and I am a junior at the University of Michigan studying Information Science with a concentration in Information Analysis and Business Administration.

        <p>
            I am extremely passionate about cooking and living a healthy lifestyle and decided to create this page to document my journey in the kitchen. <br>
            Growing up, my grandmother taught me how to cook and I always loved lending her a hand in the kitchen for family meals and events. <br>
            I was also very active growing up, and played sports most of my life, so fueling my body with good food was always important to me. <br>
            These two factors are what inspired me to become passionate about creating healthy recipes in the kitchen and I love sharing my creations.
        </p>

        <p>
            I love experimenting in the kitchen and creating recipes that allow me to feel my best. Even if I am not the most talented chef in the kitchen, <br>
            cooking and baking have always been my favorite hobby and I am so excited to share some of the things I've created.
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope you enjoy my page!
